who begs in your mind

(slightly smiling,patient,unspeaking
with a sign on his
breast
BLIND)yes i

am this person of whom somehow
you are never wholly rid(and who

does not ask for more than
just enough dreams to
live on)
        after all,kid

you might as well
toss him a few thoughts

a little love preferably,
anything which you can’t
pass off on other people:for
instance a
plugged promise—

then he will maybe(hearing something
fall into his hat)go wandering
after it with fingers;till having

found
what was thrown away
                     himself
taptaptaps out of your brain,hopes,life

to(carefully turning a
corner)never bother you any more.</div>
