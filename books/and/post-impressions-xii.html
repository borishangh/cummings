young death sits in a café
smiling,a piece of money held between
his thumb and first finger

and “Death is young
life wears velour trousers
life totters,life has a beard” i

Life?he is there and here,
or that,or this
or nothing or an old man 3 thirds

flowers,always crying

                     will He buy?

she is sitting beside young death,is slender;
likes flowers.</div>
