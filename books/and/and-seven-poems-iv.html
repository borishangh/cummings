        <div class="poem-text">Who
    threw the silver dollar up into the tree?
                                              I didn’t said the little
lady who sews and grows every day paler-paler she sits sewing and grow-
ing and that’s the truth,
who threw

         the ripe melon into the tree?you
                                          got me said the smoke who
runs the elevator but I bet two bits come seven come eleven mm make
the world safe for democracy it never fails and that’s a fact;

who threw the

bunch of violets
                 into the tree?I dunno said the silver dog,   with ripe
eyes and wagged his tail that’s the god’s own

and the moon kissed the little lady on her paler-paler face and said
never mind,you’ll find
                       But the moon creeped into the pink hand of the
smoke that shook the ivories
                             and she said said She Win and you won’t be

sorry    And The Moon came!along-along to the waggy silver dog
and the moon came
and the Moon said into his Ripe Eyes
                                     and the moon
                                                  Smiled</div>
